### **4. Final Touches**
1. **Add a License**:
   - Use an MIT license for open contributions:
     ```bash
     touch LICENSE
     git add LICENSE
     git commit -m "Add MIT license"
     ```

2. **Add a Screenshot/Logo**:
   - Include a `screenshots/` folder with images of the app and reference them in the README.

3. **Update the Repository Description**:
   - Add topics such as `MERN`, `marketplace`, `handmade-goods` for discoverability.
